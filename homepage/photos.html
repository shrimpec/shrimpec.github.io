      <h3>
        <p>This is it. The smallest church in Bushwick. In the heart and soul of Bushwick.</p>
        <p>For many, the church is only a hop and a skip away from their place of rest. Just pass the popular Catholic Church on St. Nicholas Avenue, the one flooding with families with children of all ages, mainly Hispanics. The local Food Bazaar on Gates Ave, the one with the parking lot where many husbands of the Catholic Church would sit in their cars for their wives to come back with some pollo guisado and a tamarindo drink. The Myrtle-Wyckoff Avenue station down the block with the Sunday morning commuters ready for the day ahead. The wind dancing with the stench of urine and coffee. A little further and you hit the high school of three, Bushwick High School. Closed on Sundays but always in the minds of the neighborhood parents. This school was the one all the neighborhood parents threaten you with if you did horrible in your school afar. Continuing down the road, you’d hit the church across the street from the bodega with the red awning, the store we all go to for some seltzer water on a Sunday morning or a Bacon, Egg and Cheese sandwich.</p>
        <p>When you pass by, the sounds of old garage gates being pulled open by old Hispanic guys getting the dominos ready for the night’s game or local laundromats opening up for the early morning wash. The parked cars are quiet and silent after a night on the town. The spray painted walls and gates, painting a scene that you would never find in a movie. The smallest cracks and crevices are being put to work on Sunday morning. Tagged gates and all, the neighborhood would slowly arise on Sunday morning.</p>
        <p>Lifehouse Community Church, the Christian Church on Irving and Jefferson Ave (not to be confused with Jefferson Street, two completely different sides of Bushwick). The beige brick of the corner building mixed with the tagged black gates stopped to make way for the wide windows of the old storefront. The side of Jefferson Avenue being the smallest of the windows, but the most welcoming.</p>
        <p>Walk through the creaking wooden door and a “Good morning, my love,” or “Hey, Baby,” is coming for you. The melodies of chatty church folk flow into your ears like an open fire hydrant. Hug and kiss being the side for the Sunday morning meal. After the greeting, comes the seating of your family in a row of chairs. The black with golden spots lined the chairs, the chairs being the place you sat last Sunday. The smell of the carpet seeping into your nose, almost like a breath of old air in your lungs. The same old air the people around you are breathing.</p>
        <p>The church was the first place I brought my best friend to. My best friend got to see lives transformed and witnessed powerful stories.</p>
        <p>First stepping in, “Hello! I’m her uncle and it’s nice to meet you,” flowing with love. While being a witness to some stories, some others were better off told. The story of the Puerto Rican that came from a broken family, the father an addict and the mother one of abuse. The Jamaican with a single mother who raised him while playing the role of both parents. All now serving on the outreach team or on the worship team or tech team. All with families with children and grandchildren. All with nieces and nephews. All with homes. All in relationships. All whole again.</p>
        <p>With no context or storytelling, my best friend would mistake these beautiful people for brothers and sisters. Or maybe it was the symphonies of laughter. Or the gentle manner of speaking. Or the no-filters, the rawness of conversation. Or the smiles. Or little prayers in the room. All of these would give the illusion of family, but it was no illusion. Family is family and that’s it.</p>
        <p>Some of the most memorable Sundays were the ones where the leadership would gather to talk about the next events outside of the church walls. The kiddos would just settle in the basement for hours and hours with food chatting amongst one another for what felt like days, but also no time at all. The conversations being picked up from last week’s Sunday service or the texting conversation we had last. Maybe it was a new interaction. From the “Yo Mama” jokes to the flirtatious comments, one of the kids would pull out the Phase 10 cards. The cards being the thing us kids loved to play and bond over. One set and a run kept us playing for hours and hours. These times would come and go and I would miss it. The boy that I had loved for years finally just sitting and talking with me. Us inching closer, but not too close as our siblings are still around. The cherry red cheeks and the relentless smiles say it all.</p>
        <p>“No parents, no problem” was the unspoken saying between us. No judgment, just us being ourselves and loving everything detail about each other. Us treating each other like family but in our case, a crush.</p>
        <p>The old church basement was not only a hang out with painted concrete flooring, dyed the colors of the crayons that were tragically stepped on or a place where the old musty smell suffocated us, but the old church basement was a place of intimacy. Personal moments through conversation or a glare or a smile. It was a place where us young people were speaking into each other’s souls for as much as the time allotted, until the parents would holler at us to go up the blue carpeted stairs, back into the hardships of the world around the church, the world back home.</p>
        <p>While the basement being one place, there was a world outside the confines of the beige building. On some of the coldest or hottest nights, the church stepped outside. The church being the people and not the building anymore. On the corner, outside with the people in our surrounding hood, we would meet peoples’ needs. A coat for you and a box of food, whatever your heart desires or whatever you need. The people of Bushwick would form a human chain down and around the block from the congregated church folk. The people of Knickerbocker Avenue, the street parallel to that of Irving, become curious as they see the chain and come to join the commotion. A coat to keep one person after another warm when they had no one to hold them. A box of food for one person after the another to make sure the family in the old gray building was fed. The man’s family who never saw a joyful Thanksgiving, never had the funds for a turkey or stuffing. The kids never received a new toy for Christmas, using their broken toys. Broken people receive broken things, but the life from the outpour of the church replaced those broken things. The Mount Everest of stuffed animals from my best friend or the donations from partnering organizations, would do more than replace the toys but replace those frowns with smiles.</p>
        <p>Lifehouse, the house of life and love. Community, being the congregated people inside and outside of the building. Church, the church established in the Christian religion. Lifehouse Community Church, the house of life, love and family rooted in faith with its family in the heart and soul of Bushwick.</p>
